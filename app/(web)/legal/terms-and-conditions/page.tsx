            <p>
              Nove represents and warrants that Creator’s use of the Platforms shall not be
              materially encumbered by any third-party claim that Nove has infringed such third
              party’s intellectual property or similar rights. As a condition precedent to any other
              remedy, Creator’s first remedy to any breach of the obligations in this Section shall
              be provision by Nove of a reasonable workaround or other accommodation that enables
              Creator to continue using the Platforms substantially in accordance with this
              Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, Creator’s sole and exclusive remedy to a breach
              of the obligations in this Section shall be termination and refund of any pre-paid
              subscription fees.

              If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a

            <li>
              No waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid unless in writing signed by the

              YOU AND PLATFORM AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY
              PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES SHALL BE DONE SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
              THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, A REPRESENTATIVE
              ACTION, A COLLECTIVE ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY PROCEEDING

              Any dispute, controversy, proceeding, or claim arising out of or in connection with or

            <li>
              The arbitration will be conducted in New York County, New York, unless You and Nove
              agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
              in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall be deemed as
              preventing Platform or Creator from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from
              the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
              misappropriation, dilution, or violation of our data security, intellectual property
              rights, or other proprietary rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Platform or Creator may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop
              unauthorized use or abuse of the Platform or intellectual property infringement (for
              example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging
              in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the
              agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to You or Your claim, You agree to the
              exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in the County of New
              York in the State of New York to resolve Your claim.

              You also agree that no proceeding will be joined, consolidated, or combined with
