        cookies on your device. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer
        or mobile device when you visit the website. It enables the website to remember your actions
        and preferences (such as login, language, or other preferences) over a period of time, so

      <p>
        Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT
        is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information
        about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We do
        not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is
        currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with
        DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
      </p>
      <h2 id='security-and-data-retention'>7. Security and Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Data
        when you enter, submit, or access your Personal Data. For example, when possible, we use
        encryption to transfer and store data. We further limit access to this data using access
        controls and confidentiality commitments.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no website, application, or transmission can guarantee security. Thus, while we
        have established and maintain what we believe to be reasonable procedures to protect the
        confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal data obtained through our websites or
        Services, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We retain information from or about you for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
        outlined in this Privacy Policy. When the information is no longer necessary for these
        purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you, unless we are
        required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention
        period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services
        requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you,
        possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide
        to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided
        by law and the statute of limitations.
